# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple graphical implementation of the classic game tic-tac-toe.

Players alternate placing X's or O's into a 3x3 grid.
The first player to get 3 of either symbol in a row (diagonal,
horizontal, or vertical), wins!


# Requirements

Java openjdk runtime >= 11.0.2 (or equivalent from Oracle).

# Compilation / running

From the root project directory (which contains this `README` file):
1. `javac src/main/java/TicTacToeGame.java`
2. `java -cp src/main/java TicTacToeGame`

The expected result is "Hello, world!".
